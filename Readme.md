# libvirt/KVM-Notes
These are collection of notes/script I use with libvirt/KVM on [Debian bookworm](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBookworm).

Do not confuse this with:
* A copy & paste source (insert "Think Mark! Think!" meme)
* A documentation. (for that goto e.g. [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/))
* A magic problem solver (nothing on the internet is)

**Note: Always think before using/copy something from the internet!**\
**Note: When you break something by using any resources provided. Thats on you!**

# Folders
